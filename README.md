# GRU Sentiment Analysis Model

## **Overview**

This project implements a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model using PyTorch for sentiment analysis. The GRU model is particularly effective for sequence data like text and has been used here to classify textual data into sentiment categories.

## **Model Architecture**

The model uses the following architecture:

- An **Embedding Layer** to convert text data into dense vector representations.
- One or more **GRU Layers** to process the sequence data.
- A **Fully Connected Layer** to interpret the GRU output and make predictions.
- **Dropout** for regularization to prevent overfitting.

## **Dataset**

The dataset used for training and testing the GRU model comprises [describe your dataset here, including features like text length, number of classes, etc.].

## **Preprocessing**

The text data was preprocessed using the following steps:

1. Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
2. Text Cleaning: Removing special characters, numbers, and other non-essential elements.
3. Vectorization: Converting tokens into numerical format for model input.
4. Padding/Truncating: Ensuring all sequences are of uniform length.

## **Training**

The model was trained using:

- Loss Function: Cross-Entropy Loss, suitable for multi-class classification.
- Optimizer: [Name of optimizer], typically Adam or SGD.
- Number of Epochs: [X] epochs.

## **Requirements**

Key Python libraries used in this project include:

- PyTorch
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Gensim
- NLTK

These can be installed using the **`requirements.txt`** file provided.

## **Usage**

To use the model for sentiment analysis:

1. Preprocess your input text data using the same steps as in the training phase.
2. Load the model using the saved state dictionary.
3. Pass the processed data through the model to get predictions.

## **Evaluation**

The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy metrics on a separate test dataset, achieving an accuracy of [X]% on this dataset.
